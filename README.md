# firebase_tutorial
working CRUD example, created and commented by following this tutorial http://softauthor.com/learn-to-build-firebase-crud-app-with-javascript-part01-reading-data/ his code in the tutorial is buggy so i fixed it in my version. this repo is bug free as far as my testing goes anyway

* create a file in this directory called environment_vars.js
* copy the below variables into it
* replace the placeholder values with the appropriate values from your firebase config
## in environment_vars.js ##
var API_KEY = "yourApiKey",
`AUTH_DOMAIN = "...",
DATABASE_URL = "...",
PROJECT_ID = "...",
SENDER_ID = "..."`
